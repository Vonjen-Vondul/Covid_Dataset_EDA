# COVID-19 Dataset Exploration and Preparation for In-Depth Analysis and Visualization

In the world of data analysis, understanding and preparing your dataset are fundamental steps. Let's dive into the process of Exploratory Data Preparation (EDP) for the COVID-19 dataset using SQL. We will explain the reasons behind various SQL operations performed on the dataset.

1. Data Exploration
The initial part of the code includes basic data exploration steps, such as viewing the dataset, sorting it by relevant columns, and extracting specific columns for analysis.

2. Likelihood of Dying in Nigeria

Reason: This code calculates the percentage of COVID-19 cases resulting in death in Nigeria. Understanding this statistic is crucial for assessing the severity of the disease in a specific location.

3. Percentage of Population Infected in Nigeria

Reason: This code calculates the percentage of the population that contracted COVID-19 in Nigeria. It provides insights into the virus's spread relative to the population size.

4. Countries with the Highest Infection Rates Compared to Population

Reason: This code identifies and ranks countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population size. This information can help identify areas with a more severe impact of COVID-19.

5. Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population

Reason: This code identifies and ranks countries with the highest COVID-19 death counts relative to their population. It provides insights into the impact of the virus on different countries.

6. Continents with Death Counts per Population

Reason: This code groups data by continent and calculates the death counts relative to the population for each continent. It helps understand how different continents are affected by COVID-19.

7. Global COVID-19 Numbers

Reason: This code calculates and displays global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage over time. It provides a global perspective on the pandemic.

8. Joining COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccinations Data

Reason: This code combines COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data, enabling comprehensive analysis of the impact of vaccinations on the pandemic's progression.

9. Visualizing Vaccination Data

Reason: This code creates a view to store vaccination data, making it easier to visualize and analyze vaccination trends and their impact on the population.

With these data exploration and preparation steps, the COVID-19 dataset is now ready for in-depth analysis and visualization. Clean and structured data is essential for extracting valuable insights and understanding the dynamics of the pandemic.
